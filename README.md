# Book Sales Data Analysis Project 📚

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the global book market. Using Python, I analyzed a dataset of over 1,000 book entries to uncover trends in publishing, sales performance, and reader preferences. 

The goal was to transform raw data into actionable insights regarding author ratings, pricing strategies, and revenue distribution across publishers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** * **Pandas:** Data cleaning and manipulation
    * **Matplotlib:** Core data visualization
    * **Seaborn:** Advanced statistical plotting

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handled negative values in publishing years, managed missing language codes, and removed entries without book names to ensure data integrity.
2.  **Statistical Summary:** Analyzed distribution of ratings (average ~4.0/5) and sales counts.
3.  **Visualization:** * **Market Trends:** Visualized the growth of book releases over the years.
    * **Correlation:** Analyzed the relationship between **Sale Price** and **Units Sold**.
    * **Revenue Analysis:** Identified top-performing publishers (e.g., Penguin Group) and authors by gross sales.
    * **Global Reach:** Mapped the distribution of books by language code.

## 📈 Key Insights
* **Price Sensitivity:** There is a clear trend where lower sale prices generally lead to a higher volume of units sold.
* **Genre Dominance:** Identified which genres have the highest average ratings versus the highest sales volume.
* **Publishing Hotspots:** The majority of the dataset consists of modern releases, with English being the dominant language (over 70%).

## 📂 Dataset
The data used in this project was sourced from **Kaggle**. It includes features such as:
* Book Name & Author
* Publishing Year
* Average Rating & Ratings Count
* Gross Sales & Publisher Revenue
* Units Sold

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python script to see the analysis.
